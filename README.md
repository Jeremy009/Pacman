Project OOP in Physics</br>
Prof. Steven Lowette</br>
Result: 19/20

This is my assignment for Object Oriented Programming in Physics, written and compiled with Qt 5.11. It is a copy of the well-known Pacman game.

The list of interesting files:</br>
Game.cpp</br>
Ghosts.cpp</br>
Health.cpp</br>
Level.cpp</br>
main.cpp</br>
MovingObjects.cpp</br>
Score.cpp</br>
Tile.cpp</br>

The file classView.pdf contains an overview of all classes and their methods. All other files are resources needed for execution.
